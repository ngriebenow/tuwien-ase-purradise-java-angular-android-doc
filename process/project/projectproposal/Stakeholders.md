## Stakeholders
   + **Users of the application:**
      + *Animal shelter customers:* For animal shelter customers it is very important that the application has a good usability. The features must be easily understandable and intuitive. The goal of the application in regards of animal shelter customers is to animate them to adopt animals, specifically the most suitable animals, from the shelter. Therefore, the application must be pleasant and enjoyable to use.
      + *Animal shelter keepers:* For animal shelter keepers, it is very important that the app makes their work much easier. The registration and maintainability of the animals in the system should not take too much time and should not keep them from their other work. It is important that the system works reliably and is easy to use.
      + *Animal shelter administrators:* Administrators in the system should not have to do much work. They should only be needed in certain specific cases, like locking/unlocking accounts and registering new keepers. The basic features should work without any need of an administrator. 
   + **Customer (animal shelter):** The purpose of the software from a customer perspective is that the administrational work in assigning animals to customers is reduced. The second important feature is that the animals get paired with suitable customers, where they may be happy, and not to random people. Therefore, the application aims to increase the efficiency of the adoption process. The application must be economically valuable for the customer. It should decrease the number of animals returned to the shelter and decrease the worktime of the keepers administrating the animals standing for adoption. It should also increase the interest of customers for adopting animals.
   + **Animals in the shelters:** The application should optimize the matching of animals with customers. Therefore, animals should be adopted by customers depending on which environment is most suitable for the animals. Thus, the application may decrease the quantity of animals living in the shelter.
   + **Developers:** The features of the application should be implemented in the given time. The used technologies should help and not hinder the development. The application should use state of the art technologies. The developers should present a functional, modern and usable application to the customers in order to impress them and fulfill their needs.
