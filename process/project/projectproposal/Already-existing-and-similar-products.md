There is an abundance of animal shelters located all around the world, many of them having their own website. A lot of them offer potential customers to look at a list of animals that are up for adoption online, some of them also provide the possibility to filter by characteristics such as type of animal or age. Occasionally, there are separate questionnaires or quizzes on the shelter’s website to determine a suitable pet; however, our research turned up no shelters which linked the results of their quizzes with their own currently available pets, i.e. there were no shelters which showed a potential customer which of the available pets would be the best match for the customer based on the quiz.   

As for mobile applications featuring AR or VR pets, there are a lot which are freely available on platforms such as the Google Play Store. However, those apps are generally designed to provide children with a Tamagotchi-like virtual companion and usually do not serve the purpose of helping people interested in adopting a pet decide which pet to choose.  

The closest match we could find is a design prototype by UI/UX designer Jessica Tsui called Pawfect Match. It is designed as an Android application which should look and feel like a Google product. It incorporates a questionnaire about different lifestyle aspects which may influence the choice of a pet. The questionnaire is then used to filter animals of local shelters and provides a list of compatible pets that are up for adoption. It also offers the possibility to look at an AR model as well as details of a selected pet. Additionally, interested customers may contact the caretakers of a pet to receive further information or schedule a visit with the pet.
