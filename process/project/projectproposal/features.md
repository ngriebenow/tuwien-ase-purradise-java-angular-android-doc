### Features

The main feature of the application is that a customer can adopt an animal from an animal shelter. This animal should be suited for him/her. The basic workflow (not complete) is illustrated in \[1\].

 * A customer can use the adoption services using the Web app in the browser or by downloading the Android app.
 * After a customer is logged in, he/she can set preferences in the system. These include but are not limited to type of animal, characteristics of the animals, interests of the person (active lifestyle, ...).
 * When the customer has set preferences, he/she gets to see recommended animals based on his/her preferences.
 * A customer can view animal details. This includes pictures, a description and the preferences of the animal (e.g. needs garden, very active, ...). When using the Android app, the customer has the posssibility to see the animal in his/her enviroment using augmented reality.
 * The customer can add animals he/she is interested in to the watchlist. When he/she is satisfied with the list, he/she can make an appointment at the animal shelter to adopt an animal.
 * The customer can also view all of his/her previously adopted animals in a list.
 * The keepers at the animal shelter can add new animals, edit existing ones and delete them from the system.
 * At an appointment, the keeper can assign an animal to a customer, so that the animal is no longer available for adoption.

Additionally to the adoption, the system also needs administration:
- Customers may change their password.
- Customers may delete their account.
- Keepers may change their password.
- Administrators may lock and unlock users.
- Administrators may create new keepers and administrators.
- Administrators may reset passwords.
