# Coding Guidelines
The code giudelines are inspired by the Google's coding standards for source code in the Javaâ„¢ Programming Language.      
https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html
## File encoding
Files are encoded in UTF-8
## Imports
### Wildcard Imports
Wildcard imports are not used. All imports must be fully qualified.
### Import Ordering
Imports are ordered as follows:
1.  All static imports in a single block.
2.  All non-static imports in a single block.
Between the static and the non-static imports is an empty line. Imports are ordered by name.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
import static test.TestClass.testMethod;

import java.util.Map;
import static test.TestClass;
import static test.TestClass.NestedClass;
</pre>

## Classes
### Exactly one top-level class declaration
Each top-level class resides in a source file of its own.
### Ordering of class contents
The content of a class should be implemented in a logical order. Generally it should be in the form:
 * constant members
 * final members
 * non-final members
 * constructor
 * methods
 * inner classes
Overloaded methods should not be split - there are no other methods in between those two.

## Formatting
### One statment per line
Each statement is followed by a line break.
### Block Indentation
The block indintation (e.g. at an if) is **4 spaces**.
### Lines
#### Line Length
A line is at maximum **120 characters** long.
Exceptions:
* package statment
* import statements
* urls in Strings or javadoc
#### Line-Wrapping
When a line is going ot be wrapped, it is at these points:
 * before an operator like (`+`, `-`) as well as `.`, `::` operators
 * before a generic statement (`<T extends Foo & Bar>`)
 * after a assignement operator
 * After an opening parenthesis `(`. The parenthesis stays in the line.
 * After a comma in a parameter list or method call
 * After a lambda arrow only if the body contains exactly one statement

When a statement is wrapped, it is continued with 4 spaced indentation.

**Note:** The primary goal for line wrapping is to have clear code, _not necessarily_ code that fits in the smallest number of lines.

### Braces
#### Braces are used where optional
Braces are **always** used with `if`, `else`, `for`, `do` and `while` statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.
#### K & R style
Braces follow the Kernighan and Ritchie style ("Egyptian brackets") for nonempty blocks and block-like constructs:
*   No line break before the opening brace.
*   Line break after the opening brace.
*   Line break before the closing brace.
*   Line break after the closing brace, _only if_ that brace terminates a statement or terminates the body of a method, constructor, or _named_ class. For example, there is _no_ line break after the brace if it is followed by `else` or a comma.
Examples:

```
return () -> {
    while (condition()) {
        method();
    }
};

return new MyClass() {
    @Override public void method() {
        if (condition()) {
            try {
                something();
            } catch (ProblemException e) {
                recover();
            }
        } else if (otherCondition()) {
            somethingElse();
        } else {
            lastThing();
        }
    }
};
```
### Whitespaces
#### Vertical
Blank lines are required to be between two methods, constructors, ... (exept between two member variables of the same type - e.g. final static, final, non-final).

Blank lines are always allowed to be used to improve readability.

#### Horizontal
##### Statments
There must be a space between the statement and the parenthisis in statements like `if`, `for`, ... and between the brace and the statement in statements like `else`, `catch`, ... .
##### Operators
There must be a space between the value and the operator.
```
int a = 1 + 2; // OK
int a=1+2; // Not OK
``` 
#### Parameters
There must be a whitespace after a `,` in a parameter list (method definition and method call).

## Naming
We always use english names.
### Packages
Package names are all lowercase, with consecutive words simply concatenated together (no underscores). For example, com.example.deepspace
### Classes
Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.
Class names are typically nouns (`Map`) or noun phrases (`ImmutableList`).
Interface names can also be adjective phrases (`Readable`).
### Methods
Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.

Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases. For example, sendMessage or stop.

Underscores may appear in JUnit test mehtod names.

### Constants
Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE.
### Variables, Parameters
Variables and parameters use lowerCamelCase.

## Programming Practices

### `@Override`: always used
A method is marked with the `@Override` annotation whenever it is legal. This includes a class method overriding a superclass method, a class method implementing an interface method, and an interface method respecifying a superinterface method.

### Caught exceptions: not ignored

Except as noted below, it is very rarely correct to do nothing in response to a caught exception. (Typical responses are to log it, or if it is considered "impossible", rethrow it as an `AssertionError`.)

When it truly is appropriate to take no action whatsoever in a catch block, the reason this is justified is explained in a comment.
```
try {
    int i = Integer.parseInt(response);
    return handleNumericResponse(i);
} catch (NumberFormatException ok) {
    // it's not numeric; that's fine, just continue
}
return handleTextResponse(response);
```

**Exception:** In tests, a caught exception may be ignored without comment _if_ its name is or begins with `expected`. The following is a very common idiom for ensuring that the code under test _does_ throw an exception of the expected type, so a comment is unnecessary here.
```
try {
    emptyStack.pop();
    fail();
} catch (NoSuchElementException expected) {
}
```

### Static members: qualified using class

When a reference to a static class member must be qualified, it is qualified with that class's name, not with a reference or expression of that class's type.
```
Foo aFoo = ...;
Foo.aStaticMethod(); // good
aFoo.aStaticMethod(); // bad
somethingThatYieldsAFoo().aStaticMethod(); // very bad
```

## Javadoc
### Formatting
The _basic_ formatting of Javadoc blocks is as seen in this example:
```
/**
 * Multiple lines of Javadoc text are written here,
 * wrapped normally...
 */
public int method(String p1) { ... }
```
... or in this single-line example:
```
** An especially short bit of Javadoc. */
```
### Summary Fragment
The summary fragment consists of noun and verb phrases instead of full sentences. (`Returns the customer ID` instead of `This method returns ...`)

### Block Tags
When block-tags are used, they are not allowed to be empty.

There are no Block-Tags in a single-line javadoc (`/** Returns the customer ID **/` instead of `/** @return the customer ID **/`).

### Usage
Every public and protected method should have a javadoc.
Classes can have a javadoc, but don't have to.

**Exception:** Javadoc is optional for "simple, obvious" methods like `getFoo()`, in cases where there really and truly is nothing else worthwhile to say but `"Returns the foo"`.

**Exception:** Javadoc is not always present on a method that overrides a supertype method.
