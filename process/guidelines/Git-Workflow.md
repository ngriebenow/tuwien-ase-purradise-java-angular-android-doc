 - After that a short summary should be given in max. 70 characters.
 - The subject line is capitalized (it starts with a capital letter).
 - The subject line starts with a verb in imperative mood, e.g. Add, Remove, Move, Delete, Change, Fix ...
 - The subject line must not end with a period.
 - An empty line separates the subject line from the body.
 - A commit can, but don't have to have a body.
 - The body contains a more detailed description of the commit.
 - A line in the body does not succede 80 characters in length.
 - In the wiki, commits generally don't have a body.
