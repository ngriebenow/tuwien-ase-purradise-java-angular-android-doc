## IDE
Android development is done in Android Studio, which is from the same company as IntelliJ, thus very similar.

### Installing
Android Studio is installed via the Jetbrains Toolbox (https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/)

When you have installed the Jetbrains-Toolbox, open it and install Android Studio.
