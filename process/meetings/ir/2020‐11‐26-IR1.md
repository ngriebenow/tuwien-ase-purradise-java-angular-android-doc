### Goals
Present our code to our code tutor

## Discussion
`@Component` -> either all in one line or one line per selector, templateUrl, styleUrls

`
@Component({
    selector: "jhi-animal-update",
    templateUrl: "./animal-update.component.html",
    styleUrls: ["./animal-update.component.scss"]
})
`

Use trailing commas where possible so that you can better maintain your code
`
    styleUrls: ["./animal-update.component.scss"],
`

Update != Create  
JPA update  
get object by id of persistence context  
edit object  
when @Transactional  

save -> should create a new entity  

Not every entity needs a service  

One feature one package that includes REST, service, persistence layer  

For maintenance reasons: feature-based splitting of services  
cohesion high  
coupling low  

Do not say "If something went wrong throws RuntimeException"  
RuntimeException is used to detect programming mistakes  

Logging: use string format  

Homepage  
Flexbox flex-direction column  
body flex  
header and footer fixed size  
then body is always in between  

Setter  
Fluent Style: return this  
Getter  
instead of getId() also id() is possible  

isIsSeen  (RecommendationDTO)  

Spring Security for customer 1 vs. customer 2  
add additional annotations to make sure which  
write security expressions within the annotation  

Passwords -> max. 5 attempts, but only for users  

logger: use static  

SpeciesRepository  
decouple name from query -> use annotation instead of SQL query  
especially when using very long names  

RecommendationResource: use class-wide path "/recommendations"  

omit verbs in urls AccountResource  
use "registration" instead of "register"  

use foreach ("of" keyword instead of "in") instead of for loop with counter i

use find/filter instead of for loop  

Question query params vs filter dto  

HomeFragment refactor check if logged in (not twice)

Rename Get the "id" adoption -> "get adoption with given id"  

Logging: calling LOGGER.trace("...") at the beginning of methods is useful for debugging
