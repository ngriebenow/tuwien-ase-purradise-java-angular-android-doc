## Discussion
We should change the Architecture diagram to be more layered (backend).

In the end, only the code that is used should be in the repository. Only code what you need. There is a risk in code generation tools such as JHipster.

Manual system test: Identify test cases and describe/document them!

Use more categories for the Scrum board. (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Implementation, Reviewing). Extend the board!

First sprint: Tackle advanced feature ASAP. Find responsible person for jhipster.
Review technical design.

24h before MRx, branch to master and add tag. Add README.md for explanations how to start the application.

Define Release Manager Role who tags the branches. Rather do not squash commits.

We cannot use Gitlab pages.

We will schedule MR2 on 2020-12-10 09:00 - approximately 10:30.
