## Discussion
Web: 
- "icon cat icon for not leaving alone"
- find out more (animal overview) vs. view in recommendations
- do not refresh recommendations when hiding animal
- Registration: what is necessary to fill out, add asterisk or add notifications
- align text links in admin Administration
- entity updated with id --> updated with "name"


Android:
- align icons in view animal
- filter: reset filter button

MR3:
- all issues should be completed
- diff analysis, focus on new/updated features of feedback

Code:
- IDE Plugin: SonarLint
- unused fields, unused imports, names
- logging -> use format instead of string concat, better performance, check at compile time
- logging concept for operations, e.g. update, delete entity
- RecommendationServiceImpl: refactor/restructure -> test service with mocking
- while loading -> "Fix animal not found"

No deployment, focus on quality
