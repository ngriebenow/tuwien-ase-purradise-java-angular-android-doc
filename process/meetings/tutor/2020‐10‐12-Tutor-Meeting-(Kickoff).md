# Tutor Meeting (Kick-Off)

## Project Proposal
On 21.10.2020, we have to present the project proposal. PDF is enough, we do not necessarily need a slide.
We can send our project proposal to Matthias for review as soon as we have finished it. We have to agree with Matthias for a time slot in Tuwel.

## Advanced Feature
ASE has strong focus on Advanced Feature that should be cool and outstanding.
Examples: Virtual/Augmented Reality, Machine Learning, clear distinction from SEPM

## Weekly Tutor jour-fixe
We agreed that we will have our weekly tutor meetings Thursdays, 09:00.

## Important Dates
MR1: 03.11 - 05.11 (Kickoff togehter with Assistant)
IR1: 23.11 – 27.11 (together with another Tutor)
MR2: 09.12 – 15.12 (approx. 60% of the project, the features should be visible)
IR2: 11.01 – 15.01
MR3: 25.01 – 29.01
MRs might take place in-person.

## ASE-Day
After MR3, the ASE-Day will take place. This is only a short presentation, no impact on grading.

## Time Logging
All team members should have approximately the same logged time (bad example: A: 70h, B: 20h)
We should book time ASAP, in the same week at the very latest.

## Git flow
We are required to have a proper branching strategy: (feat/dev/master/hotfix)
We will have exactly one issue per commit.
24h before MRx, we have to branch to the master branch and tag it.

## Grading
Each team member will receive an individual grade.

## Tricks
- The advanced feature has to be outstanding, which is clearly distinct from SEPM. For instance: Distributed playlists, different platforms (Android and Angular, own app), Machine Learning, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality. But it should not be a feature that we can easily integrate with 3 lines of code.
- Rather have more items in backlog for the project proposal than to few. Always have an answer to "Why so few features".
- Proper Project Management
- Continuous Integration is beneficial.
- Time logging important
