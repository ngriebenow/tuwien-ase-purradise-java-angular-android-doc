# Tutor Meeting


## Assistant
Ask assistant what is important to them.

## MR1
UI Prototype is always a good idea.

## Project Contract
Project Contract should contain all requirements, but it does not necessarily have them as user stories. Better to define them via Sprint plan

## Build Tool
We can use Maven or/and Gradle.

## Web-based AR
We do not necessarily need to implement AR feature for web-based environment.

## Time
Try to reach 150h/team member, not more than 160h/team member.
