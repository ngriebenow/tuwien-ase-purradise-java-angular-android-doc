# Internal Meeting

## Project idea
We decided to go for an animal sanctuary.

Entities for CRUD: animal, customer, keeper, administrator
user roles: keeper, administrators, customer

## Features

- The customer wants to adopt an animal. They can specify their preferences (animal type, ...). Animals have preferences too (garden, running). The systems gives recommendations.

- The customer wants to browse different animals that are available for going for a walk. Some animals (dogs, but other animals work as well) need to go for a walk (either customers (or keepers) do that), some animals need daily care, special case if animal is sick.

- The customer can have animal sponsorship (Tierpatenschaft)

## Optional Features
- The keeper wants to know which animals need vaccines or need to go to the vet

- The animal shelter system should give people who already have animals the possibility to register their own animals. If they are unable to go for a walk with them (due to sickness, travel, etc.), then other customers can take care of them for one or a few days.


## Advanced feature
Best Matching, Scheduling (Nurse Rostering Problem)
