# Internal/Tutor Meeting

# Solution Name
We found a catchy name: Purr-adise

# Model uploading
When creating a new animal, the keeper has the possibility to either select an existing 3D model based on a selection that we provide including different coat colors or to upload a custom 3D file representing the individual animal.

# Sprintplanning
We decided to split the first sprint into two sprints Ã  2 weeks.

# UI Interface
We decided to have an English user interface.

# Substitute Roles
We set the substitute roles in the project proposal.

# Meeting time
We set the meeting time between 09:00 and 20:00.

# Further steps
Nicolas @01617265: add feature description for keeper to upload 3D model for race/individual, refine use case for customer to only see a 3D model of race, Customer can download such images for free for instance in ...
Ask tutor if german/english, what he thinks about advanced feature
